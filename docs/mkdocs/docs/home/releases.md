## Summary
This release contains improvements of the fkYAML library's internal operations with some reorganization of CMake scripts.  
In addition, the analysis result from Codacy has become shown at the top of the README.md file.  

!!! warning "CAVEAT"

    The fkYAML library is an alpha quality software, at most.  
    It would take a while until this library gets stabled version, since implementation and maintenance has been/will be done by a single developer.  
    If you find a bug or wanted features, please open a discussion/issue to let me know.  
    Any kind of contribution is very much welcomed.

# **fkYAML version 0.1.1**

## Summary
This release contains a hotfix for the test suite to check CMake integration with FetchContent module which uses the old fkYAML APIs.  
All changes are backward-compatible. See [release notes of version 0.1.0](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/releases/tag/v0.1.0) for more information on other features.  

### CAVEAT

# **fkYAML version 0.1.0**

## Summary
This release contains a huge change in public APIs, including naming conventions and migration of serialization/deserialization features to fkyaml::basic_node class APIs.  
Furthermore, internal implementation of the fkYAML library has been intentionally moved to `include/fkYAML/detail`'s subdirectories so that we can provide as much backward compatibility as possible for the future releases.

# **fkYAML v0.0.0**

This release provides basic features of the fkYAML library.  
Major known issues and limitaions are as follows:  

- %TAG directives are not supported. (Will surely be implemented.)
- YAML key must be a string literal. (YAML specification of any version does not restrict YAML keys as such.)
- Backward compatibilities for YAML 1.1 or older have not yet been implemented.

The other issues and limitations will also be fixed in later versions.  
Wait for such a version, or create a PR to fix one.
