!!! abstract "Release Packages"

    * [fkYAML.tgz](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/releases/download/v0.2.0/fkYAML.tgz)
    * [fkYAML.zip](https://github.com/fktn-k/fkYAML/releases/download/v0.2.0/fkYAML.zip)

### Summary

This release contains a breaking change in the default type for YAML mapping node: it will no longer preserve insertion order of internal key/value pairs by default.  
To preserve the insertion order as it used to, use `fkyaml::ordered_map` as `basic_node`'s mapping node type.  
Furthermore, factory methods for scalar values of `basic_node` type have been removed and unified into the `basic_node` constructors.  
Along with the above changes, internal operations in the fkYAML have also been improved regarding conversions between YAML nodes and values of native data types.  

!!! warning CAVEAT

    The fkYAML library is an alpha quality software, at most.  
    It would take a while until this library gets stabled version, since implementation and maintenance has been/will be done by a single developer.  
    If you find a bug or wanted features, please open a discussion/issue to let me know.  
    Any kind of contribution is very much welcomed.

## **fkYAML v0.0.0**

This release provides basic features of the fkYAML library.  
Major known issues and limitaions are as follows:  

- %TAG directives are not supported. (Will surely be implemented.)
- YAML key must be a string literal. (YAML specification of any version does not restrict YAML keys as such.)
- Backward compatibilities for YAML 1.1 or older have not yet been implemented.

The other issues and limitations will also be fixed in later versions.  
Wait for such a version, or create a PR to fix one.
