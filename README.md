# fkYAML
fkYAML is a C++ header-only C++ library to deal with YAML.  
If you want portability & development speed-up, fkYAML is the way to go.  
No need to build a library only for a third party project.  
You can add YAML support into your projects by just including header files where it's needed.  

## How to Use

Coming soon.

## How to Install
